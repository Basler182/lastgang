Load profile analysis

# Problem definition
The transformation of the energy system towards fluctuating energy sources such as solar or wind energy poses challenges for grids and energy markets. Industrial companies can help stabilize the energy system by adapting their consumption behavior and investing in battery storage or in energy generation plants such as photovoltaics.

# Challenge
The interface between companies and the public grid and the energy markets is a digital electricity meter at the grid interconnection point. A value is recorded here for every quarter of an hour of the year. The values strung together produce a so-called "load profile". This load profile can be described as a fingerprint of a company's energy consumption and offers huge potential for analyzing the structure of a company's energy consumption and identifying potential for improvement.

# Solution

The software displays the histogram of a load profile of a company and allows the user to analyze the load profile and identify potential for improvement in the energy consumption behavior of a company.
It also allows the user to simulate the effect of a change in the energy consumption behavior of a company on the load profile and the associated costs.
